# Hydro Savior

Hydro Savior is a mobile application designed to raise awareness about water pollution and encourage public involvement in reducing plastic waste and optimizing water quality. Our app brings interactive learning, real-world action, and engaging gameplay to users to address the environmental crisis of plastic pollution in our hydrosphere.

## üåç Problem
Our oceans sustain life but are under threat from plastic pollution. Currently, over 400 dead zones exist globally due to contamination, and 17.6 billion pounds of plastic are dumped into the sea every year. This pollution breaks down into microplastics, affecting the water we drink, the food we eat, and even the air we breathe.

## üöÄ Solution
Hydro Savior aims to tackle this challenge by:

Creating public awareness on the effects of plastic pollution.
Providing users with interactive tools to reduce waste and optimize water quality.
Empowering users to take real-world action in their communities.
